# Posts application
This is a simple posts application built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Vite** and **Redux Toolkit**. The application allows users to fetch, display, and manage a list of posts.

### Steps to Set Up the Project Locally

1. **Clone the repository**:

   Clone the project from the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AnnaTsybel/picsio-test-task.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   After cloning the repository, navigate to the project folder and install the necessary dependencies. You can use either **npm** or **yarn**.

   Using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:

   To start the application in development mode, run the following command:

   Using npm:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will launch the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The page will reload automatically if you make any edits to the code.

4. **Build for production**:

   If you want to build the app for production, use the following command:

   Using npm:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   
   This will create a production-ready build in the `dist` directory.

## Technical Stack

This project is built using the following technologies:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. We use functional components and React Hooks to manage component state and lifecycle events.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and maintainability by catching errors at compile time.
- **Redux Toolkit**: A modern and efficient approach to state management in Redux. It simplifies the configuration and provides powerful tools like `createSlice`, `createAsyncThunk`, and `configureStore`.
- **SCSS**: A CSS preprocessor that extends CSS with variables, nested rules, and mixins, enabling more maintainable and scalable styles.
- **Vite**: A next-generation frontend build tool that is fast and lean. Vite improves development speed by offering instant server start, fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR), and optimized production builds.
